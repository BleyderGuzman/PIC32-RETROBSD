PIC32-RETROBSD is OSHW board based on PIC32-Pinguino-MICRO modification with PIC32MX795F512H processor and RetroBSD bootloader. The board comes loaded with bootloader and RETROBSD.

The default file system (to preapre a microSD card) can be downloaded using the torrent in folder "Default binaries".

If you want to restore the bootloader and RETROBSD firmware use the binary "BOOT+RETRDOBSD2.hex" from folder "Default binaries". You would need a programmer tool like PIC-KIT3 and adapter for the small 6-pin ICSP connector (0.05" step).

If you are looking for the latest software sources - the best idea would be to visit the RETROBSD web-site and forum.
